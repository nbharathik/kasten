//! Markdown to text runs and back: the small dialect that operations take
//! for the words on a slide, and that the outline is written in.
//!
//! **Lines.** Every non-blank line is a paragraph; blank lines separate
//! nothing.
//!
//! - `- x`, `* x` and `+ x` are bullets, `1. x` and `1) x` numbered items
//!   (the number is not kept). Two spaces, or a tab, of indent make one
//!   level, up to five. A marker needs a space after it, so `-x` and `*x*`
//!   are text.
//! - `# x` is a paragraph in the `title` style, `## x` in `subtitle`, `> x`
//!   in `quote`; `### x` and deeper is body text made bold.
//! - Three or more backticks or tildes open a fence, closed by the same
//!   character or by the end of the text. Each line inside is a `code`
//!   paragraph, kept as it is.
//! - Two spaces or a backslash at the end of a line keep the next line in the
//!   same paragraph, with a `\n` between the words.
//!
//! **Inside a line.** `**bold**`, `__bold__`, `*italic*`, `_italic_`,
//! `~~strike~~`, `<u>underline</u>`, `` `code` ``, `[text](url)`,
//! `<https://autolink>`, `$latex$` and `$$latex$$`. Emphasis nests, and is
//! paired the way CommonMark pairs it, so `snake_case` stays whole. A price
//! such as "$5 and $6" is not math. A backslash before one of
//! ``\ * _ ~ ` [ ] ( ) < > $ # - + .`` makes it plain text. A marker that
//! does not close is text. `<b>`, `<i>` and `<s>` are read too, so that the
//! serializer always has an exact form to fall back on.
//!
//! [`to_markdown`] undoes [`parse`]: reading what it wrote gives back the
//! same paragraphs. Colour, size and font are not Markdown and are left out.
