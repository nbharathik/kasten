//! Decks and agents. `update_deck` reads a deck, lets the caller change it and
//! writes it back under one hold of the write lock, so a change made by an
//! agent starts from the deck as it is and no copy is ever needed. The rest
//! weighs, shows and runs the two deck ops an agent's tools make (`EditDeck`,
//! `CreateDeck`) and the sending of a deck to the trash.
