//! Composite elements become primitives. A composite (code, math, a chat, a
//! grid of cards ...) is stored with a few fields of its own; `expand` turns it
//! into the text, shapes, lines and pictures it is drawn with, in slide
//! coordinates. The editor, present mode and the PowerPoint export all draw
//! that expansion, so they always look the same. "Ungroup to shapes" is
//! the expansion made permanent.
//!
//! One file (or folder) for each kind, each with `expand(&Ctx, &Kind) -> Vec<Element>`
//! and its tests. `build.rs` has what they share for making parts, `geom.rs` keeps
//! them inside the box, and `measure.rs` estimates how much room text takes so
//! that sizes are chosen to fit.
