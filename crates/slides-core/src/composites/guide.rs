Keep to about 25 lines of 60 columns. `focus` walks through the code, one entry per step (\"1\", \"2-3\", \"4,6-10\"; line 1 is the first line of `code`): other lines dim at that step, and the slide gets that many steps."

Keep formulas short, and size the box like the formula: the picture fills the box."

Five or six short messages fit a slide; the type shrinks to fit down to 12 pt and then runs past the box, so trim messages rather than cram them."
