//! Quitting, restarting and hiding the window write the page's waiting
//! typing first. The request is held and the page is asked to write what
//! is waiting (features/workspace/page/close-writes.ts); it calls
//! `pages_written` when that is done. A page that does not answer, busy or
//! broken, never keeps the app open: after a few seconds it goes ahead
//! anyway, and asking again goes ahead at once.
//!
//! `flow.rs` decides what each request does; this carries it out. Only the
//! main window takes part: any other window closes on its own.
