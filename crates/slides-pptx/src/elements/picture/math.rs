//! A formula whose picture the host could not make. PowerPoint cannot typeset
//! LaTeX, so the exporter would normally be handed a picture of each formula under
//! the name the deck gives it (`math/<hash>.png`). When that picture is missing,
//! the formula is written as text in its box instead of a grey stand-in: the
//! LaTeX source, in italics, in the theme's text colour, centred. It is not
//! typeset, but it can be read and it can be edited.
