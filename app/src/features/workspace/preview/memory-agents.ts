// The browser preview's history and agents:
// every write is a version of its note, as every op is a commit in the core,
// and a note's versions go with it when it moves. What the chat's and the
// brainstorm's stand-ins write as an agent is kept as versions in the
// agent's session (agent-sessions.ts), notes, boards and decks alike, so History
// lists the session and undoing it reverts all of it, newest first, as the
// core does with git. Agents that connect over MCP need a vault on disk, so
// the preview has no proposals.
