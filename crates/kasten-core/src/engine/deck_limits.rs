//! What makes a deck op wait for review whoever is trusted: a deck sent to the
//! trash, and taking too many slides out of decks. The second is added up over
//! the session's last ten minutes (`Tally`), so a limit of three cannot be
//! kept a call at a time, and it counts what a change does to the deck as it
//! is now: the slides it removes, the slides it leaves with nothing on them
//! (their ids are still there), and for an edit that replaces the whole deck
//! every slide it does not leave as it was. A change a person accepted is not
//! counted; they looked at it.
