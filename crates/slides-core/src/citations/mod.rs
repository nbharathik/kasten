//! Citations: reading a bibliography, looking up the works a citation names,
//! writing them in the formats a slide asks for, and numbering them across a deck.
//!
//! A bibliography is BibTeX text that the host supplies (Kasten reads the `.bib`
//! files of the vault; the `slides` command reads `refs.bib` beside the deck),
//! read here into [`Refs`]. A citation element holds keys and a format; [`lines`]
//! writes them, given the [`Refs`] that can say who wrote each work and the
//! [`Numbering`] that says which number each work has in the deck. Drawing never
//! fails on a key it cannot find: the key is shown, marked, and lint reports it.
