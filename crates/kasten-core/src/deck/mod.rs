//! Slide decks (`.deck` files), made and changed by the Slides editor, the
//! `slides` command and agents. A deck is JSON in one fixed form, written
//! by the editor's own engine; core keeps it as text and looks only at its
//! envelope (format, version, title, slide count) and at the image files it
//! names. Nothing here rewrites a deck's text, and a save never replaces a
//! file it did not read: a stale save goes to a copy beside it.
