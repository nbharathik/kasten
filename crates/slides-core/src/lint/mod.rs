//! Lint: the problems in a deck that a person or an agent should put right
//! before it is shown or sent, found by rules that read the deck as it is
//! drawn (composites expanded) and report in plain words, each with the fix.
//!
//! [`lint_deck`] checks every slide and [`lint_slide`] one; a slide's issues
//! are the same in either. Two rules need something the deck cannot say. Text
//! that overflows its box can only be found where the words are laid out, so
//! a host that draws them (a browser) passes [`Measures`]; one that does not
//! may pass an estimate. A citation key can only be checked against a
//! bibliography, passed as [`Refs`]. Without them those rules are named in
//! [`Report::skipped`], never left out silently.
