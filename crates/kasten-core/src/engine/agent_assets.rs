//! What an agent may add to `assets/`, and a deck it imports with the

//! (docs/vault-format.md, guardrails): a size for one picture, and how many
//! pictures and bytes of them a session may add in ten minutes. A picture
//! over a limit is refused, not held for review, since a proposal would have
//! to carry the picture; nothing is written for it, and an import that meets
//! a limit on the way leaves nothing behind.
