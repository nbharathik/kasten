## Why tools?
- Models know what they were trained on
- A tool reaches what they cannot know

Notes:
Start with a question: what could the model not answer alone?

## Two views
- The model asks
- The host runs it

- The answer comes back
- The loop goes on

## Part two <!-- layout: section -->

## Ask, act, observe
> Make it work, make it right, make it fast.

## A first call
```python
result = search(\"weather in Oslo\")
print(result)
```
