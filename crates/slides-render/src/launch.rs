//! Starting the browser: the program and its flags, a profile folder of its own, and its sandbox.
//!
//! The browser decodes the pictures a deck names, and a deck can come from an agent, so its sandbox is what stands
//! between a hostile picture and this user's files. It is on unless the person switches it off on purpose
//! (`SLIDES_RENDER_NO_SANDBOX=1`, for a container that is itself the boundary they trust); it is never switched off
//! because something failed, and a browser that will not start with it says so and names the setting.
